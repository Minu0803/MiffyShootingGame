Space Shooter Game

Space Shooter Game is a 2D arcade-style shooting game built with Python and Pygame. The player controls a spaceship that can move in all directions to avoid and shoot enemies. The objective is to shoot down as many enemies as possible while avoiding collisions. Each enemy has health points (HP) that decrease when hit by bullets, and they disappear once their HP reaches zero.
